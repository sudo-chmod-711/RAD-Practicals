Activities
1. Create a Node.js function that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.
2. Create an array of numbers in Node.js and print the square of each number.
3. Create an array of numbers in Node.js and find the maximum number in the array. Hint: Use the Math.max() function to find the maximum number in an array.
4. Create a Node.js function named factorial that takes a positive integer as input and returns its factorial.
Hint: Consider using recursion to calculate the factorial of a number.
5. Create a Node.js script that reads a JSON file named data.json, parses its content, and displays the values of the "name" and "age" properties.
Hint: Use the fs module to read the JSON file, then parse its content using JSON.parse() to access and display the "name" and "age" properties.
6. Create a Node.js program that takes a string as input and prints its reverse to the console. Hint: Use the split(), reverse(), and join() methods to reverse the input string.
7. Write a Node.js program that reads a CSV file named "data.csv" and displays its content in a tabular format.
Hint: You need to install the csv-parser package using npm (e.g. npm install csv-parser).
8. Write a Node.js program that fetches data from an API (e.g. https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) and displays the response to the console. Hint: You need to install the axios package using npm (e.g. npm install axios).
